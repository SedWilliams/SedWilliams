### About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, and a the moment I'm focusing on getting the most out of my studies and seeing what ways I can apply what I learn. I write on my [portfolio](https://shedrickwilliams.me/home) site where you can expect to find posts about my perspective as a current college student in San Franciso, CA, what I learn along the way, and how exactly I learned it. -Shedrick

Go into no project or learning endeavor thinking you know everything or more than the next person, but instead, see what knowledge there is to gain from the project, endeavor, or person, and what you can do for it in return.
