### About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, and a the moment I'm focusing on getting the most out of my studies and seeing what ways I can apply what I learn. I write on my [portfolio](https://shedrickwilliams.me/home) site where you can expect to find posts about my perspective as a current college student in San Franciso, CA, what I learn along the way, and how exactly I learned it. -Shedrick
