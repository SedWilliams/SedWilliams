### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, and a the moment I'm focusing on getting the most out of my studies and seeing what creative ways I can apply them. I blog over on [my portfolio site](shedrickwilliams.me) where you can expect to find posts about my perspective as a current college student in San Franciso, CA, what I learn along the way, and how exactly I learned it. Check me out for a fresh, non-corporate, view of the field.
