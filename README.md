### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, looking to gain practical experience through internships and employment opportunities. I love building side projects and turning them into products that can help others. And my goal is to continuously learn and grow as a developer while contributing to the tech community.

### Projects & Interests
